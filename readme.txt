Lets you change your username to something else than "admin". 

== Description ==

When installing WordPress the administrator's username is automatically set to "admin" and can't be changed from within WP. If you want to have a different login name you can either modify the WordPress database manually (if you know what you're doing) or use this plugin and save yourself some trouble.

After activating the plugin click on "Change Username" in the "Users" menu on the Dashboard. You will see a form displaying your current login and a field where you can enter your desired new username. Simply enter the new username in the form, click "Save Changes" and follow the provided "Log in" link to login with your new username. Easy :)


== Installation ==

To install the plugin follow these steps :

1. Download the change-admin-username.zip file to your local machine.
1. Unzip the file 
1. Upload "change-admin-username" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to 'Users->Change Username' to change your username.
